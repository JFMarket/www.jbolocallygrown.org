# Developing
1. Clone this repo.
1. Run `vagrant up`
1. Browse to http://localhost:8080 and see that the webserver is installed and running.
1. Create a topic branch to make changes on.
1. Use your favorite editor to add a new feature or fix a bug.
1. File changes are automatically synced to the VM. A refresh should be sufficient to see them.
1. Once the feature is ready to be reviewed, push the branch to GitHub and create a Pull Request (https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)
so that it can be reviewed before being merged into master.
